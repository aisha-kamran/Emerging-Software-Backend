Static version of the AdminPanel frontend

This folder contains a plain HTML/CSS/JS approximation of the React frontend.

Files
- index.html — main entry.
- styles.css — basic styling.
- app.js — simple client-side router and page renderers.

How to open
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local static server).
2. Use the hash links (e.g., `#/login`) to navigate.

Notes
- The static site is a simplified reproduction; interactive features are basic and use `localStorage` for demo login.
- For full fidelity, run the original React app via `npm run build` once Node is installed to get production bundles.
